An Atari's Challenge clone

This is a little yet funny project i build in 8 hours, including planning.

To run locally i highly recommend to use a server, in my case, http-server, which is a little server for NodeJS.

With http-server i just run:

http-server -i -d /path/to/folder/

And go to the web browser and type localhost/index.html

Is just a prototype, so help me found errors. Any help is welcome.
